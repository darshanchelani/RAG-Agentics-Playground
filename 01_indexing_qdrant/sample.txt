The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata.
It is a conversation between prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer.

In the conversation, Krishna provides guidance on how to live a righteous life,
the nature of the self, and the path to liberation (moksha).

The Gita addresses the concepts of duty, action, and devotion,
and has influenced spiritual thought in India for centuries.
