# ðŸ”„ Module 05: Multi-Query RAG (RAG-Fusion Base)

This module teaches how to rephrase a single user query into **multiple semantic variants** to retrieve a richer, more complete set of documents.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

- One query might miss important chunks
- Multiple phrasings help the retriever find **wider** coverage
- Reduces hallucinations, increases factuality

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
